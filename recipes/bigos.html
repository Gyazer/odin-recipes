        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ing-list">
            <li>50g butter</li>
            <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1 tsp juniper berries, crushed</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp caraway seeds</li>
            <li>300g lean pork belly, cubed</li>
            <li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>500g sauerkraut</li>
            <li>half a white cabbage, shredded</li>
            <li>200g fresh chopped tomatoes <em>or</em> 400g tin tomatoes</li>
            <li>500ml chicken <em>or</em>beef stock</li>
            <li>10g dried mushrooms</li>
            <li>300g smoked Polish kielbasa, chopped</li>
            <li>1 apple, grated</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="steps-list">
            <li>Melt the butter in a large casserole. Add the onion and saut√© over a medium heat until the onion is softened and translucent.<br>
                Sprinkle over the juniper berries and caraway, then add the pork. Sprinkle over the brown sugar. <br>
                Turn the heat up high for a couple of minutes, turning the meat so it browns well.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Drain the sauerkraut well and give it a rinse if you want to reduce the vinegar flavour. <br>
                The easiest thing to do is squeeze it out with your hands. Add to the casserole with the white cabbage and chopped tomatoes,<br>
                then pour over the stock. Simmer for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Soak the dried mushrooms in warm water. When they have softened, drain, adding their soaking liquor to the casserole. <br> 
                Chop the mushrooms finely and add these to the casserole, along with the sausage and apple.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Simmer for a further hour and a half and serve or cover overnight and reheat the following day.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>Many recipes recommend making this stew 2 days in advance, cooking properly the first day, for a further hour the seocnd day, <br>
            and another hour before serving on the final day. It will still taste really good on the first day though!</em></p>
