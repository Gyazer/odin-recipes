        <h2 class="desc-header">Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Barszcz Czerwony</strong> is, to put it simply; <em>the soup of the gods.</em> The Polish word "barszcz" means; borscht, and to be fair, that's exactly what <br>
            barszcz is. Though, traditiona borscht is made commonly of meat, tomatoes and cabbage, barszcz is more of a basic beet broth that is a deep red colour. <br>
            Barszcz is a fantastic warming soup, usually eaten hot, accompanied by boiled potatoes or slices of bread. Commonly for Polish Wigilia, barszcz is served <br>
            with little mushroom dumplings called "uszka". Whatever occasion it may be, a good bowl of barszcz never dissappoints!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ing-list">
            <li>4 whole beets</li>
            <li>4 cups stock (chicken, beef, mushroom, or vegetable)</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>

        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="steps-list">
            <li>If using fresh beets, heat oven to 200 C. Wrap beets in aluminium foil and place on a baking dish. <br>
            Roast until tender, about 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>When cool enough to handle, peel, and slice into strips of julienne. If you prefer, julienne some for garnish and dice the rest.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a medium pot, bring meat or vegetable stock to a boil. Add the cut beets, garlic, lemon juice, sugar, salt, and pepper.<br>
            Simmer 10 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Serve hot with optional boiled potatoes and garnish with chopped dill.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p><em>Steamed beets can also be used, and some say they make barszcz taste even better!<br>
            Cut them in quarters & steam for 30 minutes until tender;<br>
            the skin will be easily wiped-off, then follow the rest of the recipe!</em></p>
