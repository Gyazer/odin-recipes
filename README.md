Hello.
This is the beginning of my first project with The Odin Project.
So far I have enjoyed learning how to create websites.
It feels gratifying seeing what you type appear in your browser, just like a normal website would.
It starts to feel real, like you're actually making progress.
I swear to complete this entire course, and once I finish it all I will come back and add the final, 7th line.
